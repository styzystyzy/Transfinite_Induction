# Transfinite_Induction
Transfinite induction is an important proof technique in set theory, topology, algebra, computer science and other fields. In this work, wepresent a formal proof of transfinite induction on the basis of Morse-Kelley set theory. Furthermore, according to the minimum principle, we formally prove two forms of mathematical induction which is a special form on non-negative integers of transfinite induction. All proofs are checked formally using the Coq proof assistant in which Morse-Kelley set theory is formalized.
